  clarifications:
    - "For all questions: Only describe the parts (algo, proof, runtime) that the question explicitly asks for, i.e. if the question does not explicitly mention a proof or runtime is needed, you do NOT need to provide one."
    - "1.4: you can assume that the losses are in [0, 1]"
    - "2.3: ties are broken alphabetically"
    - "4: you are allowed to write the LP in any form. The canonical form is below."
    - "4: the constraint written as a,b,c should be x,y,z."
    - "6: You are also given k. You also know which island is Hawaii and which one is Guinland."
    - "7: the robber can't take an item multiple times (i.e., no replacement). You can also assume the weights of each item are integers."
    - "8.1: use w(0)=[1,1,1],l(0)=[1/2,2/3,0] and l(1)=[1/2,1/3,1]. The indices on the exam paper are off by 1. The third iteration corresponds to picking probabilities based on weights in w(2)."
    - "8.2: 'wrong' means chose a non-winning action. Solution to 8 might have a wording problem. After rereading, it seems that the weight sum of correct experts is at most 1/2, as under the assumption that Param lost, it otherwise would not choose that action."

  clarifications:
    - "Q2iii solution is corrected as a=0, b=0.5, c=0.5."
    - "Q3 solution is incorrect, should be X=2 by comparing columns 1 and 3."
    - "Q4b x1+x2+x3=0 should be x1+x2+x3=1."
    - "Q7 has a typo in the solution, it should be u+1 to v not v+1 to u."
    - "Q9b has a typo in case 2 of the recurrence for F(u,i). It should read: there's a typo in case 2 of the recurrence for F(u,i)F(u,i). It should read: F(u,1)=W[u,uL​]+W[u,uR​]+min⁡a,b∈1,…,k​{F(uL​,a)+F(uR​,b)}F(u,1)=W[u,uL​​]+W[u,uR​​]+mina,b∈1,…,k​​{F(uL​​,a)+F(uR​​,b)} F(u,i)=min⁡{F(uR​,i−1)+F(uL​,a)+W[u,uL​]∀a≤k−1F(uL​,i−1)+F(uR​,a)+W[u,uR​]∀a≤k−1F(uL​,a)+F(uR​,i−a−1)∀a≤i−1F(u,i)=min⎩ ⎨ ⎧​F(uR​​,i−1)+F(uL​​,a)+W[u,uL​​]F(uL​​,i−1)+F(uR​​,a)+W[u,uR​​]F(uL​​,a)+F(uR​​,i−a−1)​∀a≤k−1∀a≤k−1∀a≤i−1​."

  clarifications:
    - "Q6 (game): LP formulation may not be needed."
    - "Q7 (nice): The original rubric requires (mod P) to be included in the recurrence relations for full credit."
    - "Grade will be amended if you received penalty. Grade only goes up."
